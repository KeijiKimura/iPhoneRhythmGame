# iPhoneRhythmGame


This is the rhythm game that utilizes the iPhone's accelerometer.  

Use the 'QWE' keys to simulate the tilting function that you would perform if you built and played the game on an iPhone.  

The game allows any sound file to generate blocks based on BPM and off beat/ up beat / quarter / eigth beats.  

Music by Grimes.
